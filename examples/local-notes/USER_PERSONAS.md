# User Personas — Local Notes
> Working notes, not final spec

---

## 🔒 The Privacy-First User

### User Benefits

1. I know with certainty that my notes have never touched a server I don't control
2. I stop trading convenience for surveillance — I get both
3. I can write freely without wondering who might read it, sell it, or subpoena it
4. I don't need an account, which means there's no profile to breach, sell, or deactivate
5. I have a notes tool that still works even if the company behind it disappears tomorrow
6. I stop paying a monthly fee to rent access to my own thoughts
7. I trust the tool completely, which means I actually use it — instead of keeping sensitive things in my head

## ⚡ The Quick-Capture Person

### User Benefits

1. The thought is captured before it's gone — nothing loads, nothing asks me to sign in
2. I stop losing good ideas to the gap between having them and finding somewhere to put them
3. I keep one tab open all day and it's always ready, like a notepad on a desk
4. I never have to decide where to put something — I just put it somewhere and deal with it later
5. I get out of the app as fast as I got in — no menus, no prompts, no friction on exit
6. I stop using random text files, chat messages to myself, and email drafts as a scratch pad
7. The bar to capture is low enough that I actually capture things instead of telling myself I'll remember

## 💻 The Developer Scratchpad

### User Benefits

1. I have a place for all the stuff that doesn't belong in a file — half-formed commands, test values, debug traces
2. I keep one notebook per project and switch contexts without losing my place
3. I stop pasting sensitive things into cloud tools that probably index them
4. I find yesterday's curl command in three seconds without digging through terminal history
5. It lives in the browser where I already am — no alt-tab, no app launch, no context switch
6. I can close and reopen the tab and everything is still there, exactly as I left it
7. I stop treating my clipboard as a short-term memory system

## 😤 The Bloat-Hater

### User Benefits

1. I open the app and it does the thing — no onboarding, no tour, no "what are you trying to do today?"
2. I stop paying for features I resent being there
3. I get the version of the tool that existed before someone added a database, a marketplace, and a mobile app
4. I write notes without the app suggesting I turn them into a wiki, a board, or a template
5. Nothing has changed the next time I open it — no forced update, no redesign, no feature that moved
6. I feel in control again, which I didn't realize I'd lost until I had it back
7. I recommend it to people without embarrassment — it does exactly what it says

## ⚖️ The Sensitive-Work Professional

### User Benefits

1. I take notes freely during client conversations without worrying about what I'm consenting to in the terms of service
2. I have a clear, defensible answer if anyone asks where client information was stored
3. I stop self-censoring my own notes because the tool makes me nervous
4. I can show a compliance officer exactly where the data lives — it's right there, in the browser, nowhere else
5. I don't have to file a vendor security review to start using a notes tool
6. I keep separate notebooks per client or matter without any of them commingling on a shared server
7. I write better notes because I'm not editing myself — and better notes mean better work
